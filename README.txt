# USING MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES FOR CLASSIFICATION AND FEATURE SELECTION IN THE GENOMIC SIMULATED DATA

This project focuses on binary classification tasks, specifically distinguishing between case and control groups, using simulated single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) datasets. Each dataset presents a unique form of complex association, including multivariate additive effects, epistasis, and genetic heterogeneity. The project aims to familiarize participants with fundamental concepts such as data preprocessing, various feature selection techniques, machine learning modeling approaches, automated machine learning, and interpreting model results


## Introduction
Feature Selection and Classification using Machine in the simulated genomic datasets.

Goals: 
Determine Best Feature Selection Technique for genomic datasets.
Determine the Best Machine Learning Model for classification


## Requirements to run the code.

- Jupyter Notebook
- Python 3.9.13
- conda 22.9.0
- Libraries:
  - numpy
  - pandas
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn
  - scikit-learn
  - skrebate

## Installation

1. Jupyter Notebook: If you don't have Jupyter Notebook installed, you can install it as part of the Anaconda distribution from [here](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution).

2. Python: If you don't have Python installed, download and install it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

3. Dependencies: Install the required libraries by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn skrebate

How To run Code:- 
Once you have installed all the neccessary libraries, pips and Software requirement you can follow the below steps:
1) Use Git to clone the repository to your local machine. Open your terminal or command prompt , if these do not work on your system you can use Anaconda prompt to open and navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository. Then run:  "git clone https://github.com/Akshay007-tech/590_Spring_2024_Akshay_Kalsotra.git"

2) Once the repository is cloned, navigate into the project directory: cd 590_Spring_2024_Akshay_Kalsotra  (Where you have saved the folder from GitHub)

3) Start Jupyter Notebook by running the following command: jupyter notebook

4) Open the Notebook: In the Jupyter Notebook interface, navigate to the location where you cloned the repository and find the notebook file (usually ending with .ipynb). Click on the "Akshay- Project- Master Project Code_Final" file to open it.

5) Once the notebook is open, you can run all cells by clicking on "Kernel" in the menu bar and selecting "Restart & Run All".

6) As you run the cells, you will see the output displayed below each cell. This may include plots, tables, or other visualizations generated by the code.
